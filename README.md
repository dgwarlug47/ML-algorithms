# Super-Autoregressive-Model

Built an application in Pytorch to support the complete creation of autoregressive models, including: data preparation, several features for the model, training and results analysis.
Features can be used easily through the hyper parmeters of the model declaration. They include state of the art techiniques
such as Stochastic Weight Averaging, soft labels, deep ensembling, modern neural net architectures, advanced loss functions, normalizations, different optimizers etc..
